E-commerce Product Recommendation System

Objective:
To design and develop a product recommendation system for an e-commerce platform using data structures and algorithms in Python. The system will suggest relevant products to users based on their browsing history, purchase history, and user ratings.

Key Features
1. User Authentication and Management

    User Registration and Login

    Profile Management

2. Product Management

    Add, Update, and Delete Products

    Categorize Products by Type, Brand, and Price

3. Recommendation System

    Product recommendations based on:

        User Purchase History

        Browsing History

        Similar User Preferences

4. Search and Filter Products

    Search products using different criteria (Price, Category, Rating)

    Implement Search Algorithms (Binary Search, Trie)

5. Data Analysis and Insights

    Track and analyze user interaction data

    Display most popular products

6. Review and Rating System

    Allow users to rate and review products

    Use ratings as a parameter in recommendations

7. Data Visualization

    Visualize product popularity and recommendation performance using Matplotlib or Plotly

Data Structures and Algorithms
Data Structures

    Hashmaps

    Priority Queues

    Heaps

    Linked Lists

    Trees

Algorithms

    Sorting Algorithms: Merge Sort, Quick Sort

    Search Algorithms: Binary Search, Trie

    Recommendation Algorithms:

        Collaborative Filtering (KNN)

        Content-Based Filtering using Hashmaps

    Graph Algorithms (for modeling user-product interactions)

Technologies and Libraries

    Backend: Python, Flask or Django

    Database: SQLite or MySQL

    Visualization: Matplotlib, Plotly

    Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy

    Frontend (Optional): HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

Expected Outcome

    A fully functional product recommendation system that:

        Suggests relevant products based on user interactions

        Incorporates ratings, purchases, and browsing history

    Analytical dashboards and visual insights on product popularity and user trends

    Complete documentation, codebase, and presentation for submission or demonstration
