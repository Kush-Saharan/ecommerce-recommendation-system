E-commerce Product Recommendation System

Objective:
To design and develop a product recommendation system for an e-commerce platform using data structures and algorithms in Python. The system will suggest relevant products to users based on their browsing history, purchase history, and user ratings.

Key Features:
1.	User Authentication and Management:
    o	User Registration and Login
    o	Profile Management
2.	Product Management:
    o	Add, Update, and Delete Products
    o	Categorize Products by Type, Brand, and Price
3.	Recommendation System:
    o	Product recommendations based on:
        	User Purchase History
        	Browsing History
        	Similar User Preferences
4.	Search and Filter Products:
    o	Search Products using different criteria (Price, Category, Rating)
    o	Implement Search Algorithms (Binary Search, Trie)
5.	Data Analysis and Insights:
    o	Track and Analyze User Interaction Data
    o	Display Most Popular Products
6.	Review and Rating System:
    o	Allow users to rate and review products
    o	Use ratings as a parameter in recommendations
7.	Data Visualization:
    o	Visualize product popularity and recommendation performance using Matplotlib or Plotly

Data Structures and Algorithms:
•	Data Structures: Hashmaps, Priority Queues, Heaps, Linked Lists, Trees
•	Algorithms:
    o	Sorting Algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
    o	Search Algorithms (Binary Search, Trie)
    o	Collaborative Filtering (KNN)
    o	Content-Based Filtering using Hashmaps
    o	Graph Algorithms (for user-product connections)

Technologies and Libraries:
•	Python
•	Flask/Django (for Backend)
•	SQLite/MySQL (for Database)
•	Matplotlib/Plotly (for Data Visualization)
•	Pandas and NumPy (for Data Analysis)

Expected Outcome:
•	A fully functional product recommendation system capable of suggesting products to users based on their interactions, ratings, and browsing patterns.
•	Data visualization to display insights on product popularity and recommendation accuracy.
•	Comprehensive documentation and project report.
